# **Data Structure and Algorithms Exercises**

## **Overview**

This repository contains a collection of exercises focused on Data Structures and Algorithms implemented in JavaScript. Each exercise is designed to help developers improve their understanding and implementation skills in these fundamental concepts.

## **Structure**

The repository is structured into directories, each representing a different topic or category of exercises. Inside each directory, you'll find the exercise descriptions along with starter code files where you can implement your solutions.

## **Testing**

We utilize [**Jest**](https://jestjs.io/) as our testing framework for validating the correctness of the implemented solutions. **Jest** provides a simple and effective way to write tests in JavaScript.

To run the tests locally, ensure **Jest** is installed as a development dependency:

## **Bash**

```console
npm install
```
Then, you can run the tests using the following command:
```console
npm run test
```
## **Extensions**
